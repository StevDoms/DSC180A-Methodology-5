### Question 1: What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?  
The most interesting topic we’ve covered so far is using the NetworkX package to create directed graphs. In particular, I applied it to model the distribution of the electrical grid, where individual spans are connected in a network. With this graph, I can trace each span both upstream and downstream, which allows me to assess which downstream spans might be impacted by a PSPS event occurring upstream. This is critical because it enables us to calculate the likelihood of PSPS events for each span and estimate the number of people who would be affected.
  
### Question 2: Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.  
For my Quarter 2 Project, I’d like to investigate the prediction of wildfire area size based on the fire’s location. This project would require understanding the local terrain, structures, and weather conditions specific to each location. By building a model with this information, the wildfire mitigation team could assess risk levels and prepare accordingly. This investigation would involve integrating and processing data from diverse sources to train and test the model.
  
### Question 3: What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?  
One change I’d like to make is to establish a system for validating my exploratory data analysis (EDA) and findings each week. Currently, my focus has been on completing assigned tasks, which sometimes leaves limited time to confirm the accuracy of my results. Moving forward, I hope to implement a structured process to regularly validate my analyses, particularly in preparation for quarter 2.
  
### Question 4: What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?  
I’m interested in using TensorFlow to develop a deep learning model. Although I haven’t worked extensively with TensorFlow yet, it’s highly effective for creating complex models that can handle complex patterns in data. My goal would be to incorporate this model into a dashboard that visualizes the results which makes insights easily accessible and actionable. Additionally, I’d like to set up a pipeline to feed new data continuously into the model which ensures it remains up to date.
